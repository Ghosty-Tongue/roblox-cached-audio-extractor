# Roblox Assets Extractors
 This Python script extracts cached assets such as Images (PNG), Audios (OGG or WAV) and RBXM (may include Animations) from your computer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.0 or Higher
- Windows

### Setup
- If you don't have Python, [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Open a Command Prompt, type: `pip install requests`
- Edit the `assets_extractor.py` file, and change `YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH_FOR_EXTRACTED_ASSETS` to the path where you want the extracted files to be saved. (example: "/Downloads/ExtractedAssets/")

### Executing
- Copy the path where the `assets_extractor.py` file is downloaded.
- Open Command Prompt and type: `cd PATH_HERE` and change `PATH_HERE` to the copied path.
- Then type `python assets_extractor.py` and it'll be running.

**NOTE:** This script was meant as a way to see which assets are being properly cached on your computer. Do not extract assets to publish it as your own, as that is bannable.
